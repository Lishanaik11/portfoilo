Lisha Naik - Personal Portfolio & Projects

Welcome to my personal portfolio and project showcase!

This repository demonstrates my journey in web development and tech projects, highlighting my hands-on experience, skills, and academic achievements.
This portfolio is built using React, featuring multiple pages, reusable components, and a clean, responsive design. It is fully deployed on Vercel for live access.

Project Overview
My portfolio includes three main sections, navigated by a dynamic routing system:

About Me Page:

Features a hero section with a brief introduction and a link to download my resume.

Projects Page:

Showcases my web development projects, including "Runway Ready" and "Educational Website."

Projects can be filtered by category (Full Stack, Personal, Portfolio) to help users find what they're looking for.

Each project card displays the title, description, tech stack, and a live link.

Uses React state (useState) for dynamic filtering and an interactive UI.

Key Features & Concepts Applied
React & Component-Based Architecture: The application is built with reusable components like Navbar, Footer, Home, and Project, making the codebase modular and maintainable.

State Management with Hooks: Leverages useState for managing component state (e.g., form inputs, page navigation, and project filters) and useContext for global state (e.g., theme toggling).

Responsive Design: The layout is designed using CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure a seamless user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

Theme Toggling: Implements a dark/light mode using React Context and CSS variables, allowing users to customize their viewing experience.

Client-Side Routing: Uses simple state-based routing to switch between pages without reloading the application, providing a fast and smooth user experience.

Folder & Component Structure
Your file structure appears as a single line of text because you are not using the correct Markdown formatting for code blocks or a file tree. This makes it difficult for others to read and understand your project's organization.

To fix this, you need to format the file structure using a Markdown code block with proper indentation.

### Correct Markdown for File Structure

You can create a clean, readable file structure by using a code block and a simple tree-like format.

Here is the correct way to format your file structure. You can copy and paste this code directly into your README.md file:

```markdown
## Folder & Component Structure

```
